                            <p className="text-md selection:bg-blue-100">
                                Hi I'm MarkðŸ‘‹. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in English. My native language is English, but I am also fluent in French through the completion of my dual dogwood diploma and upkeep with Duolingo. This high school diploma entails a completion of both English and French education through elementary to secondary. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, biking, and skate-skiing.
                            </p>
                            <h2 className="text-2xl selection:bg-blue-300" style={{ fontFamily: 'Lemon Milk', fontWeight: 300 }}>Computer Science</h2>
                            <p className="text-md selection:bg-blue-200">
                                I chose to major in Computer Science as I have always had a passion for technology and I wanted to learn how to create applications that could aid people in everyday life.
                                Throughout my degree, I learned a variety of different topics from Data Structures, Web Development, and Software Engineering to Data Analysis,
                                Recently, I have developed an interest in researching accessible website practices and more broadly the core principles of HCI.

                            <h2 className="text-2xl selection:bg-blue-300" style={{ fontFamily: 'Lemon Milk', fontWeight: 300 }}>English</h2>
                            <p className="text-md selection:bg-blue-200">
                                I chose to pursue a minor in English because I wanted to improve my ability research a range of different topics and sharing my findings in written form.
                                I had a number of opportunities while pursuing my minor to incooperate Computer Science.
                                For instance, in one English course I developed a website where for educators and parents to help teach the younger generation about climate change and misinformation.
                                During the development of this website I found that there did not exist a free HTML multiple-choice quiz generator.
                                Therefore, I created a simple generator using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript that would allow educators to create quizzes for their students on CMS cites like Weebly, Wix, etc. free of charge.
